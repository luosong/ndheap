# NDHeap

##About
**NDHeap** and its subclass **NDMutableHeap** are min binary heaps implemented in Objective-C for Mac OS X and iOS. You can get **NDHeap** to behave like a max binary heaps by inverting the result of the comparison function.

I wrote this to learn about how heaps work, Apple have there own CFHeap but this may be useful to other since you can use the core C function to make your own Objective-C classes that are based on a heap.
